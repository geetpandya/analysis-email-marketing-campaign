# analysis-email-marketing-campaign
Analysis an email marketing campaign dataset with 20,000 rows and 192 columns and automated the ETL process using Pig &amp; Hive. The primary purpose is to find the click-to-open-ratio (CTOR) based on different categories. Pig is used for ETL process and Hive is used for querying the data.

Prerequisites:
